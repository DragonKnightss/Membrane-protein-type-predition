  Membrane proteins play an important role in the life activities of
organisms. Knowing membrane protein types provides clues for understanding the
structure and function of proteins.
  We propose two deep learning models to process sequence information
and evolutionary information, respectively. Both models obtained better results
than traditional machine learning models. Furthermore, to improve the performance
of the sequence information model, we also provide a new vector representation
method to replace the one-hot encoding, whose overall success rate improved by
3.81% and 6.55% on two datasets. Finally, a more effective model is obtained
by fusing the above two models, whose overall success rate reached 95.68% and
92.98% on two datasets.
